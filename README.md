# Generate-CMApplicationDocumentation

Script to generate written documentation of Applications built in SCCM. Requires that the SCCM console be installed on the local device to load the requisite Powershell cmdlets, and that a list of applications (can pass wildcards) and a destination for the generated documentation be passed to the script.
